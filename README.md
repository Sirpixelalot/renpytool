# Renpytool

An Android application for extracting and creating Ren'Py RPA (Ren'Py Archive) files directly on your device.

## Features

- **Extract RPA Archives**: Unpack Ren'Py game archives to access images, scripts, audio, and other assets
- **Create RPA Archives**: Package files and folders into RPA v3 format archives
- **Batch Operations**:
  - Extract multiple RPA files at once to a shared destination folder
  - Combine multiple files/folders into a single RPA archive
- **Multi-Select Support**: Long-press to select multiple files or folders for batch operations
- **Smart Directory Defaults**: Output directory automatically defaults to the location of selected input files
- **Direct File Path Access**: Uses direct filesystem access (no SAF overhead) for fast operations
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: View extraction/creation progress with file counts, speed, and ETA
- **Custom UI**: Material Design 3 interface with custom folder icons

## Requirements

- **Android 11 (API 30) or higher**
- **MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission**: Required for direct file system access
- **Storage**: Enough space for extracted/created archives

## Installation

1. Download the latest APK from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" if needed
3. Install the APK
4. Grant storage permissions when prompted (MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android SDK with API 34+
- Python 3.8+ (for Chaquopy build)
- Gradle 8.0+

### Build Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Renpytool.git
   cd Renpytool
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Sync Gradle files (Android Studio should prompt automatically)

4. Build the APK:
   - Via Android Studio: **Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)**
   - Via Command Line:
     ```bash
     ./gradlew assembleDebug
     ```

5. The APK will be located at:
   ```
   app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

### Chaquopy Python Configuration

The project uses [Chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/) to integrate Python for RPA archive handling. Chaquopy will automatically detect your Python installation during build.

If auto-detection fails, you can manually specify your Python path in `app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
python {
    buildPython "/path/to/python"
}
```

## Usage

### Extracting RPA Archives

1. Tap the **"Extract RPA"** card
2. Browse and select one or more `.rpa` files:
   - Single tap: Select one file
   - Long-press: Enter multi-select mode to choose multiple files
3. Select the destination folder (defaults to the folder containing the RPA files)
4. Wait for extraction to complete
5. Files will be extracted to the chosen directory (overwrites existing files)

### Creating RPA Archives

1. Tap the **"Create RPA"** card
2. Browse and select files/folders to archive:
   - Single tap: Select one folder
   - Long-press: Enter multi-select mode to choose multiple items
3. Enter a name for the output RPA file (e.g., `archive.rpa`)
4. Wait for creation to complete
5. The RPA file will be created in the parent directory of selected items

### Batch Operations

**Batch Extraction:**
- Select multiple RPA files
- All files are extracted sequentially to the same destination folder
- Progress shows current file (e.g., "Extracting RPA... (2 of 5)")

**Batch Creation:**
- Select multiple files/folders
- All items are combined into a single RPA archive
- Files maintain their directory structure in the archive

## Technical Details

### RPA Format Support

- **RPA Version**: v3 (Ren'Py 7.4+)
- **Format Key**: `0xDEADBEEF` (standard Ren'Py key)
- **Compression**: ZLib

### File Operations

- Uses direct `File` API (not Storage Access Framework) for maximum performance
- Requires `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission on Android 11+
- Files are overwritten without prompting during extraction
- Batch creation uses temporary directory for combining multiple sources

### Progress Tracking

- JSON-based progress file updated in real-time
- Polling interval: 500ms
- Tracks: file count, current file, speed (files/sec), ETA

## Architecture

- **Language**: Java (Android app), Python (RPA handling)
- **UI Framework**: Material Design 3
- **Python Integration**: Chaquopy
- **RPA Library**: Custom `rpatool.py` (based on Ren'Py archive format)
- **File Picker**: Custom RecyclerView-based picker with multi-select

## Credits

- **RPA Format**: Based on [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) archive specification
- **Python Integration**: [Chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/)
- **Folder Icons**: [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)
- **Shizmob**: [rpatool](https://codeberg.org/shiz/rpatool)
